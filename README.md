# This Program is still in alpha! Do not expect it to be stable.

*I am using this as a learning project to further my knowledge in programming, so dont expect the best code :)*

This program runs on a computer connected to a gantry and pulley system to control the ability to raise and lower the curtain as well as open it and shut it horizontally



**More Information to come. Any questions? Please don't hesitate to contact me**
